# Let's travel project

This is a full-stack application that hosts a fake hotel booking site. Here you may browse through fictitious hotels around the world and simulate reserves. You can also create an account and order bookings that will be saved in the database! If you regret any booking, no worries, you may delete them!

Part of the code were written while watching a Skillshara class taught by Chris Dixon. It's a little bit old, but all the knowledge is still worthwhile!
I did my best to make this project look more like me and not simply be a copy of the teacher's code... and I'm still adding some features and correcting some bugs.

## What I learned in this project
